Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a meal is considered "Healthy" or "Unhealthy" based on its nutritional composition (calories, macros, sugar, sodium) and categorical attributes (cuisine, diet type).

The goal is to build a classification model that can automatically flag healthy meal options, which has applications in food marketing, diet tracking apps, and public health recommendation systems.


Dataset

Source: Healthy Eating Dataset 

Size: 2,000 observations

Features: 20+ columns including calories, protein, fat, cuisine, diet_type, and cooking_method.

Target: rating_Target (Binary Classification: 1 = Healthy, 0 = Unhealthy)

Data Quality Note: During the cleaning phase, an IQR analysis revealed zero statistical outliers across all numeric variables. This suggests the dataset was likely pre-cleaned or capped prior to acquisition.


Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)

Environment (Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab)
